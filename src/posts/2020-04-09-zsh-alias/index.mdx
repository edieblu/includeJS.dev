This post features my ever-growing list of `alias`-es. I will write about my `oh-my-zsh` theme settings and plugins in another post üëç.

My `zsh` aliases are written in a separate file and loaded in my `.zshrc` file like so:

- **`source $HOME/dotfiles/zsh/aliases.zsh`**

I'm using [`homebrew`](https://brew.sh/) as my package manager.


## Miscellaneous aliases

- **`alias help="tldr"`**

Because those `man` pages can be quite intimidating, I prefer to use [tldr](https://tldr.sh/) for the first, quick glance.

- **`alias top="sudo htop"`**

Interactive process viewer - to see what's hogging your memory. Good for killing processes fast!

- **`alias yt="youtube-dl"`**

For quickly downloading youtube content. More about `youtube-dl` [here](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl).

- **`alias reload="source ~/.zshrc"`**

For quickly reloading your `zshrc` config.

- **`alias finder="open -a Finder ./"`**

Open your current directory in Finder (I'm not super good with copying and moving stuff around in terminal yet).

- **`alias weather="curl -4 https://wttr.in/Brussels"`**

Check out the weather in your city.

- **`alias cat='bat'`**

`cat` with syntax highlighting and other stuff. More about `bat` [here](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat).

- **`alias md='mkdir -p'`**

Make a new directory only if one (with the same name) doesn't exist yet.

- **`alias please=sudo`**

Because being polite is cool.

- **`alias d='dirs -v | head -10'`**

Display the last ten directories.

## Git aliases
I wrote about them [here](https://includejs.dev/smashing-git).
