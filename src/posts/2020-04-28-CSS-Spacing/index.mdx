Spacing can be divided into two groups:
- inner spacing (`padding`)
- outer spacing (`margin`)

## What's a margin collapse?
Margin collapse happens when two vertical elements have a margin, and one of them has a greater margin than the other. In that case, the greater margin will be used, and the other will be ignored.

🔨 To fix: Use a single direction margin, e.g.:
```css
.element:not(:last-child) {
    margin-bottom: 1rem;
}
```

🤔 If both the parent and the child have a margin, the child's margin will be collapsed.

🔨To fix:
- Add a `border` to the parent element OR
- Change the child element `display` to `inline-block` OR
- Add `padding-top` to the parent element.


## Padding is not working
Vertical padding doesn’t work with elements that have display: inline, like `<span>` or `<a>`.

🔨 To fix: need to do `display: inline-block;`

## RTL Styling

## Gaps in Flexbox layout

Flexbox doesn't have a gap property, like `grid-gap`.

🔨 to fix:
- Add `padding-left` to the grid item AND
- Add a negative `margin-left` with the same padding-left value to the grid parent.

The reason: because the first card has padding-left while in reality it’s not needed. So it will push the wrapper to the left and cancel that unneeded space ([Demo](https://codepen.io/shadeed/pen/b4abf0f83804991925de43367562d93f?editors=1100)).

## Margin bottom

The last element should not have a bottom margin, as margin should only be between elements.

🔨 To fix: cancel the unneeded spacing by adding a negative margin to the parent element.

## `vmin`

Viewport Minimum (vmin) – A percentage of the viewport width or height, whichever is smaller. 10vmin will resolve to 10% of the current viewport width in portrait orientations, and 10% of the viewport height on landscape orientations.

## `vmax`

Viewport Maximum (vmax) – A percentage of the viewport width or height, whichever is larger. 10vmax will resolve to 10% of the current viewport height in portrait orientations, and 10% of the viewport width on landscape orientations

- `grid-gap: min(2vmax, 32px);`

Use a gap equal to 2vmax, but it shouldn’t go above 32px.
