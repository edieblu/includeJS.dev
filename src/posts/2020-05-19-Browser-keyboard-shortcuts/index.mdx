## Navigation

* `ctrl a` and `ctrl e`

For moving to the beginning/end of the line (just like in your terminal/command line!)

* `cmd + l`

Bring the URL bar into focus.

* `cmd + enter`

Duplicate the current tab (while in URL focus).

* `cmd + shift + t`

Open a tab you just closed (a lifesaver for my trigger-happy fingers).

* `cmd + d`

Add a bookmark (extra tip: when saving bookmarks to the bookmarks bar, delete all the text meaning only an icon will get displayed => you can cram many more bookmarks into your bookmarks bar 💪).

## Dev tools

 * `cmd + shift + c`

Toggles the inspect element mode (and makes for faster DOM inspection).

* Toggle the `console` from dev tools by pressing `esc` key.

* `cmd+ option + i`

To open the dev tools (in the last panel you used).

* `shift + enter`

For a multi-line entry (in the `Console`)

* `cmd + [` and `cmd + ]`

To focus next/previous panel in the dev tools.

## Have you ever wondered how to access `console.log` values? Wonder no more!

Go to the console, right-click on the logged value and click **Store as Global Variable**.

Now, this value will be stored in a variable `temp1` (`temp0` in Firefox). Nuts!

The subsequent values (in the same session) will be stored as`temp2`, `temp3`...

To get that data onto your clipboard type: `copy(temp1)` 🤯

## Firefox extras

* `cmd + shift + p`

To start private browsing.

* `cmd + k`

Move focus to the Search bar.
