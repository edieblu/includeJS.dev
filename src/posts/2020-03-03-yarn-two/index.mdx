1. **What is Yarn Plug'n'Play (PnP?)**

It's a feature of yarn 2 and it saves up space and installation time by getting rid of your projects node_modules in favor of a `.pnp.js` file. The `.pnp.js` file points to the location of where the packages are installed (`.yarn` file in your project's home directory).

2. **`yarn dlx`**

Is the counterpart to `npx` and allows you to run packages without installing them locally (only in yarn 2).

3. **`yarn up -i [package]`**

Yarn 2 is aware of workspaces. Using interactive upgrade, if you have more than one project in the workspace and the same package is used (e.g. `React`), you'll be able to choose whether you want to upgrade or keep the package.


<strong>Note to self:</strong> make sure to escape quotation marks, apostrophe etc in the `yaml` frontmatter.
