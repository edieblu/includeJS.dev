## The Ever-expanding List of Frequently Used Keyboard Shortcuts

- **`cmd + shift + \`**

For finding a matching bracket (especially useful if you're not using an extension that does that for you - like Rainbow Brackets).

- **`cmd + p`**

Quick open, go to file.

- **`cmd + p + p`**

Toggle back and forth between two files (equal to `ctrl + tab`).

- **`cmd + .`**

To toggle the auto-fix menu (for fixing indentation, etc.). This is especially useful if you're not using Prettier.

- **`cmd + 0`**

Bring focus to the sidebar. `cmd 1` to bring the focus back to the code editor.

- **`ctrl + [num]`**

Jump from tab to tab (e.g., first tab is `ctrl + 1`).

- **`F2`**

Toggle rename mode: this will change the name of that constant wherever it occurs (great for refactoring).

- **`F8`**

Go to the next error or warning.

- **`F12`**

Go to the definition (great for exploring the codebase).

- **`cmd + down arrow`**

Open a file while in file explorer (pressing the enter key will rename the file).

- **`cmd + d`**

Select multiple instances.

- **`alt + up arrow`**

Move a line of code up (you can move it down with the down arrow instead).

- **`shift + alt + down arrow`**

Duplicate lines of code down (you can do it upward, by using the up arrow instead).

- **`alt + right arrow`**

Navigate the code, word by word going right (you can go left by using the left arrow instead).

- **`cmd + right arrow`**

Jump to the end of the line (`cmd + left arrow` for the beginning of the line).

- **`cmd + l`**

Select the current line. Press the `l` key repeatedly to select more lines (expanding downward).

- **`cmd + shift + k`**

Delete the current line.

- **`cmd + shift + enter`**

Insert a line above.

- **`cmd + [`**

Increase indentation (with closing square bracket to decrease indentation).

- **`cmd + up arrow`**

Jump to the top of the file (use the down arrow to jump to the bottom of the file).

- **`ctrl + g`**

Navigate to a specific line number.

- **`cmd + backspace`**

Delete everything and place cursor to the start of that line.

- **`cmd + k + v`**

Open markdown preview (for markdown files).

- **`cmd + shift + .`**

Open breadcrumbs.

- **`cmd + p` then `@`**

Go to the command palette, then press `@` to navigate to the different sections of the file.

- **`cmd + down arrow + .`**

Open the file (through directory explorer). Pressing `enter` will toggle the rename mode.

- **`cmd + k + j`**

Open a [Quokka](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.quokka-vscode) workspace - prototyping playground.

- **`cmd + ,`**

Go to user settings.

- **`cmd + k + cmd + S`**

Open keyboard shorcuts.

## Custom shortcuts

- **`alt + w + w`**

Close all files and collapse the directory tree.

- **`capslock + right arrow`**

I'm using `capslock` as an extra modifier key (via [Karabiner-Elements](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements)), this combination splits the screen horizontally to the right (useful for comparing two files).

- **`capslock + F`**

Toggle full screen.
