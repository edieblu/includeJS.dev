I wrote about useful `git` commands previously [here](https://includejs.dev/git-mistakes) and [here](https://includejs.dev/analyze-git-logs).

Besides the Smashing Magazine link from above, I've also picked up a couple of tricks from [Harry Roberts'](https://csswizardry.com/2017/05/little-things-i-like-to-do-with-git/) and [Git Explorer](https://gitexplorer.com/).

`git branch --sort=-committerdate`

Sort branches by date.

`git checkout -`

Checkout previous branch (`-` is same as `@{-1}`).

`git branch -vv`

List branches along with commit ID, commit message, and remote.

`git status -sb`

Git status that is easier to read (I have a `gs` alias for that).

`git reflog`

To see the history of all of your `git` activity

`git log -- missing_file.txt`

Find files (even ones that were deleted).


`git shortlog -sn --all --no-merges`

To see who has committed how much ðŸ’ª.

`git shortlog -sn --since='10 weeks' --until='2 weeks'`

In a specific range.


`git for-each-ref --count=10 --sort=-committerdate refs/heads/ --format="%(refname:short)"`

See 10 most recent branches recently worked on.


`git commit --amend --no-edit`

Modify the last commit, but leave the commit message. (I will marry this one!)


`git diff --staged`

Show commited/staged changes.

`git diff [commit1] [commit2] | less`

Compare two commits and output the result in the terminal.

`git stash show -p [stash id]`

View contents of a stash. Very useful for a notorious stasher like me!
