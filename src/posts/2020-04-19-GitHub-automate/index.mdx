## Creating a GitHub PR Template

`.github/pull_request_template.md`

Create this file and directory at the root of your project. Once you've written the template, make sure to merge onto your default remote branch.

## Creating a GitHub Issue Template

 `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`

 This is where your template will live. Besides the markdown content, the template requires `frontmatter`.

```yaml
---
name: Feature Request ðŸ’¡ (name of the template)
about: Suggest a new idea for the project. ( template description)
labels: enhancement (default template labels)
---
```

## Auto-assigning PRs on GitHub

- `.github/CODEOWNERS`

Create this file at the root of your project.

* @ghuser1 @ghuser2

Add GitHub users (`*` means they will be global owners - a.k.a. the default owners for everything in the repo).

## Automatically Squash Commits on GitHub when Merging Pull Requests

Go to GitHub, Settings, scroll down to Merge button, select **"Allow squash merging"**.

## Automatically Delete Branches after Merging Pull Requests on GitHub

Go to GitHub, Settings, scroll down to Merge button and select **"Automatically delete head branches"**.

## Open a GitHub Draft Pull Request

* Proceed as if you were doing a normal PR, at the final step, instead of clicking "Create pull request", click on the dropdown arrow to the right and choose **"Create draft pull request"**.
* This will create a PR with a "draft" label. Draft PR's can't be merged. To convert it into a standard PR, click **"Ready for review"**.

## Installing GitHub CLI
