# includeJS Code of Conduct

Our code of conduct applies to all meetups organised and delivered by inculdeJS. Please make sure you familiarise yourself with it and let us know if you have any questions or concerns. Weâ€™re here to ensure we all have a good time and learn together!
<br/>

## In short

includeJS is dedicated to providing a harassment-free meetup and workshop experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We are trans-friendly.

We do not tolerate harassment of workshop participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for includeJS.

Special request: keep your hands on your computer. We understand that sometimes weâ€™re tempted to help someone by taking over their keyboard, but itâ€™s better if attendees can learn by doing, rather than by watching ðŸ™‚

## Longer version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for our meetup.

Reporting harassment
